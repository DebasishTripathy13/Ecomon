# Product Overview

Verdleaf is an AI-Verified Eco-Companion platform on Solana that transforms climate anxiety into verifiable, rewarding action. Built for the Pokéthon Hackathon 2025, it addresses three critical barriers to sustained eco-action:

1. **Invisible Impact** - Users can't see if their actions matter
2. **Trust Deficit** - 68% distrust eco-claims from brands
3. **Isolation Trap** - 62% feel alone in their eco-efforts

## Core Value Proposition

Three pillars turn eco-intentions into verified impact:

- **AI Verification** - Gemini Vision validates eco-actions with 95% accuracy

- **Real Rewards** - EcoPoints spent on verified sustainable goods
